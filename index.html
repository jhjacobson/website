<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello! My name is Josh Jacobson, and I currently live in Madison, Wisconsin. I grew up in 
Winona, Minnesota and received my bachelors in Mathematics and Gender Studies
from Saint Olaf College in 2014. 
</p>

<p>
I started at Epic immediately after graduation, where I spent 6 years in various leadership
and people management positions. I led a portion of our managed services division, 
where I helped streamline several disparate data entry and reporting systems, 
ultimately saving our management team hundreds of hours per quarter.
</p>

<p>
I left Epic in August 2020 to work as a field organizer for the Human Rights Campaign. 
After the election, my partner and I plan to move to Washington, D.C. where I hope 
to contribute to the betterment of our country by working in government.
</p>

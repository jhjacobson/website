        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Josh Jacobson, and I currently live in DC. I grew up in Winona, Minnesota and received my B.A. in Mathematics and Gender Studies from Saint Olaf College in 2014.
        </p>

        <p>
            I moved to Madison, Wisconsin to work at at Epic Systems in June 2014, where I spent 6 years in various leadership positions. I led a portion of our managed services division, where I helped streamline several disparate data entry and reporting systems,
            ultimately saving our management team hundreds of hours per quarter.
        </p>

        <p>
            I left Epic in August 2020 to work as a field organizer for the Human Rights Campaign. After the election, my partner and I moved to DC, where I am currently seeking work on the Hill and working on personal projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I listen to podcasts, play board games, cycle, bake, and learn more about technology.
        </p>

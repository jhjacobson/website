            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Josh Jacobson, and I am seeking policy and tech work in DC. I grew up in Winona, Minnesota and received my B.A. in Mathematics and Gender Studies from Saint Olaf College in 2014.
            </p>

            <p>
                I moved to Madison, Wisconsin to work at at Epic Systems in June 2014, where I spent 6 years in various leadership positions. I led a portion of our managed services division, where I helped streamline several disparate data entry and reporting systems,
                ultimately saving our management team hundreds of hours per quarter.
            </p>

            <p>
                I left Epic in August 2020 to work as a field organizer for the Human Rights Campaign. After the election, my partner and I moved to DC, where I am currently working on personal projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I listen to podcasts, play board games, cycle, bake, and learn more about technology.
            </p>
